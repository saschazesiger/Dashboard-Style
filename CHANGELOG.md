# Changelog

All notable changes. Versions follow [semver](https://semver.org): renaming or removing a token, class, hook or JS
export is a major change; adding one is a minor change.

## 0.1.0

First release.

- Tokens in three layers on `.ds-theme`: scales (motion, spacing, state layers, z), roles (neutral default palette,
  type roles, radii, elevation, focus, links, layout) and component hooks. One reduced-motion switch,
  `.ds-motion-full` opt-out.
- Motion: keyframes and the `.ds-enter`, `.ds-leave`, `.ds-stagger`, `.ds-reveal`, `.ds-collapsible` utilities;
  `.ds-enter--pop` for badges that appear; `ds-fill-x` / `ds-fill-y` with `.ds-enter--fill-x` / `--fill-y` for bars
  and columns that fill on first render.
- Opt-in page base (`.ds-base`).
- Components: button (variants, toggle, busy, focusable `aria-disabled`), spinner, sliding indicator, loading (boot,
  loading line, skeleton, loading bar), card, tiles (also clickable), lists and facts, empty state, status chip,
  alert, table (sortable headers, dense rows), form (fields, read-only, select, date, search, filters, action bar,
  checkbox, radio cards), chips, switch, combobox, progress, side sheet, dialog, snackbar, tooltip, app frame (top
  bar, navigation drawer, segmented switch, account, content panel, print styles), page layout, utilities.
- JS (ES modules and the classic `dist/ds.js`): `motion`, `indicator`, `dom` (morph), `icons` (82 outline glyphs,
  `icon()`, `iconElement()`).
- Google Sans (OFL 1.1) with `fonts.css`; theme template `themes/example.css`; living styleguide.
- `scripts/vendor.sh` and `scripts/vendor.ps1` for checksummed copies of the latest `main` (or any branch, tag or
  commit), recording the exact commit.
- Focus rings sit on `:focus` and come off with a separate `:focus:not(:focus-visible)` rule, so browsers without
  `:focus-visible` (Safari 14.1 to 15.3) keep them; no selector list mixes `:focus-visible` or `:has()` with other
  selectors (a test enforces both).
- Drawer items may be `<button>`s; `<textarea class="ds-input">` and `<fieldset class="ds-field">` with
  `<legend class="ds-field__label">` are styled; the snackbar takes `--ds-toast-bottom` and `--ds-toast-shift-y`.
- The loading bar stays visible in forced colors; the print reset of `.ds-content` and `.ds-page` comes after
  their screen rules (a test checks every print rule).
- Docs: `img-src data:` in a strict CSP (the field glyphs are data URIs), and how an embedded widget scopes its
  theme when the host page uses Dashboard-Style too.
